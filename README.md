This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle. The primary goal is to gain meaningful insights into the data by understanding its structure, identifying patterns, and answering key analytical questions.

Throughout the project, I conducted data cleaning and preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and filling null entries where appropriate to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

After preparing the dataset, I performed descriptive analysis to explore various aspects of Netflix content — including trends in release years, distribution by genre, type (Movies vs. TV Shows), countries of production, and other relevant attributes.

The insights obtained were then represented using data visualization techniques to better understand the relationships and distributions within the dataset. Visuals such as bar charts, count plots, and heatmaps were utilized for clearer interpretation.

This analysis focuses purely on data understanding and visualization. The goal is to summarize and communicate data-driven findings effectively.
